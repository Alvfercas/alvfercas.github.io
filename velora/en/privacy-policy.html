      <h1>Privacy Policy of Velora</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 03/04/2025</p>

      <p>
        At Velora, we respect your privacy and strive to be transparent about
        how we handle any type of information within our application. Below, we
        outline our privacy policy, which applies to the use of Velora, an app
        designed for IPTV content playback using <strong>Xtream Codes</strong>
        credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Velora does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable
        user information. The app does not require registration or access to
        private data such as location, email, or contacts.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Use of Xtream Codes Credentials</h2>
      <p>
        To access IPTV content, users must enter their own
        <strong>Xtream Codes</strong> credentials. These credentials are stored
        locally on the device and are neither sent nor collected by Velora. The
        security and use of these credentials are the sole responsibility of the
        user.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Content</h2>
      <p>
        Velora is an IPTV player and does not provide or host any multimedia
        content. All content accessible through the app is managed by external
        IPTV providers with whom users have an active subscription. Velora has
        no control over the legality, availability, or quality of content
        offered by third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Donations</h2>
      <p>
        Velora allows users to make voluntary donations to support the
        development of the application through <strong>PayPal</strong> and
        <strong>Buy Me a Coffee</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When accessing the donation links, users will be redirected to their
        respective payment platforms, where the transaction is securely
        processed. Velora does not collect, process, or store any financial or
        personal information related to donations.
      </p>

        personal information or store sensitive data on external servers, the
        security risks are minimal. We do not share or sell any user data to
        third parties.
